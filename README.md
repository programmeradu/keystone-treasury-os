# KeyStone: The Command Layer for Web3 Treasury Management

## Venturethon 8 Submission

### 1. The Vision
KeyStone is the AI-powered command layer for the on-chain economy. We are eliminating complex dashboards and replacing them with simple, secure, natural language prompts to orchestrate Web3 treasury operations.

### 2. What We Built (The Prototype Suite)
For this Venturethon, we built a complete, three-part functional prototype to demonstrate our vision:

* **The Solana Atlas (Live Prototype):** A free, public good dashboard for the Solana ecosystem. It serves as our user acquisition flywheel and includes an Airdrop Compass and a DeFi Strategy Simulator.
    * **Live Link:** https://keystone.stauniverse.tech/atlas

* **The ChainFlow Oracle (Core Tech Demo):** A focused demo of our core AI-powered engine, showing how natural language can simulate complex treasury flows.
*   * **Oracle Link** https://keystone.stauniverse.tech/oracle

* **The KeyStone Landing Page:** The enterprise vision for our core product, targeting DAOs, protocols, and VCs.
