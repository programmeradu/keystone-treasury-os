## 🏴‍☠️ 1. Rug Pull Detector - Trade with Confidence

**Never get rugged again.** Our advanced security scanner analyzes any Solana token in seconds to detect red flags before you buy.

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Real-time Security Analysis** - Powered by Helius DAS
- 🎯 **Risk Scoring (0-100)** - Instant verdict: Low, Medium, or High Risk
- 🔍 **Deep Token Inspection**:
  - Mint Authority Status (revoked = safe)
  - Freeze Authority Status (revoked = safe)
  - Holder Distribution (concentrated = risky)
  - Token Age (brand new = caution)
  - Community Trust Score
- 🚨 **Red Flag Detection** - Clear warnings about dangerous tokens
- 📊 **Professional UI** - Color-coded results with pass/fail indicators

### Why It Matters:
In the wild west of Solana meme coins and new launches, **this tool is your bodyguard**. Before you ape into that "next 100x", scan it first. Takes 3 seconds, could save you thousands.

### Try It Now:
Test with these addresses:
- **USDC (Safe)**: `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`
