**Script:**

[INTRO - 0:00]
What's up everyone! Today I'm HYPED to show you 3 brand new features I just launched on Solana Atlas. These are tools I wish I had when I started trading crypto. Let's dive in.

[RUG PULL DETECTOR - 0:30]
First up - the Rug Pull Detector. We've all been rugged before, right? You see a new token pumping, you ape in, and boom - developer pulls liquidity. Not anymore.

[Show screen] Here's how it works. I paste in a token address - let's try USDC first. Hit scan... and in 3 seconds we get a full security report. Risk score: 20 out of 100 - that's LOW RISK, which makes sense for USDC.

Look at these checks: Mint authority revoked - that's a green checkmark. Freeze authority revoked - another green. Over 100 holders - another pass. This is what a SAFE token looks like.

Now watch what happens when we scan a sketchy token... [scan risky token] Risk score 85 - HIGH RISK. Look at all these red flags. Mint authority NOT revoked, freeze authority active, only 5 holders. Yeah, I'm not touching that.

This tool is powered by Helius and checks real on-chain data. Before you buy anything - scan it first.

[AUTO-DCA BOTS - 2:00]
Okay, feature number two - Auto-DCA Bot Builder. DCA stands for Dollar-Cost Averaging, which is basically the strategy of buying fixed amounts on a schedule instead of trying to time the market.

[Show screen] Here's my dashboard. I've got 3 bots running:
- SOL Weekly DCA: Buys $100 of SOL every week
- JUP Monthly Stack: $50 of JUP every month  
- BONK Daily Drip: $10 of BONK every single day

Check out the performance - my SOL bot is up 2.27%. JUP bot? Up 5.04%. Why? Because I'm accumulating consistently instead of panic buying tops and panic selling bottoms.

I can pause any bot with one click. Resume it. Track my average price. See my next execution. It's completely automated.

This removes ALL emotion from your investing. Set it and forget it.

[MEV SCANNER - 3:30]
Last but definitely not least - the MEV Opportunity Scanner. MEV stands for Maximal Extractable Value, but basically this tool finds arbitrage opportunities across different Solana DEXs in real-time.

[Show screen] Right now it's showing me... SOL on Jupiter is $148.52, but on Orca it's $151.72. That's a 2.15% profit if I buy on Jupiter and sell on Orca. On 10 SOL that's $3,229 profit. Wild.

Look at BONK - 2.02% arbitrage opportunity. JUP token - also profitable. These opportunities pop up constantly but they expire fast - that's why we have this expiration countdown.

The scanner runs every 10 seconds automatically when you enable auto-scan. It's like having a trading bot watching the markets 24/7 for you.

[WHAT'S NEXT - 4:30]
So those are the 3 new features - Rug Detector, DCA Bots, MEV Scanner. All live right now at keystone.stauniverse.tech/atlas - link is in the description.

This is just the beginning. Coming soon: alert system so you get notified when opportunities appear, auto-execute MEV so you don't have to manually trade, and multi-chain support beyond just Solana.

We're building the operating system for DeFi treasuries. Think Bloomberg Terminal but open-source and crypto-native.

If you found this valuable, smash that like button, drop a comment telling me what feature you want next, and subscribe for more Web3 builder content.

Catch you in the next one! ✌️
